# Local decision layer

The permanent decision engine is the **local Ollama model**. It is a Jev-inspired classifier: it returns structured decisions, not an answer to the user. It does not use or require the paid TypeSafe Jev API.

TypeSafe's Jev model, described in [Introducing System One Models & Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev), is a proprietary system that emits typed decisions with probabilities. This project copies that *role* only. `OllamaDecisionProvider` is the default. `JevDecisionProvider` is an optional adapter and stays inactive unless `DECISION_PROVIDER=jev` and both `JEV_API_KEY` and `JEV_API_BASE` are set.

## Flow

```text
query
  -> local Ollama decision model
  -> raw probabilities
  -> JSON and probability validation
  -> post-hoc isotonic calibration
  -> calibrated confidence
  -> uncertainty check
  -> routing policy
  -> downstream LLM answer (POST /chat only)
```

`POST /decisions` stops before the downstream answer. `POST /chat` continues through the selected model.

## Modules

| Piece | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Decision provider | `providers/ollama_provider.py` | Default local classifier |
| Optional Jev provider | `providers/jev_provider.py` | Unused unless explicitly configured |
| Validation | `validation/probability_validator.py` | Parses JSON, checks probabilities, normalizes |
| Calibration | `calibration/calibrator.py` | One-vs-rest isotonic regression, separate from the prompt |
| Trainer | `calibration/trainer.py` | Runs Ollama on the dataset and saves the calibrator |
| Dataset | `calibration/dataset.json` | 45 hand-labeled queries |
| Fitted calibrator | `calibration/artifacts/calibrator.json` | Loaded on each decision |
| Raw predictions | `calibration/artifacts/raw_predictions.json` | Saved by the trainer |
| Routing | `routing/rules.json` and `routing/policy.py` | Thresholds and model choice |
| Evaluation | `evaluation/runner.py` | Test-split accuracy, F1, confusion matrix, Brier score, reliability diagram |
| API | `app/api/decisions.py` | `POST /decisions` |

## Dataset and splits

`calibration/dataset.json` holds manually labeled queries from programming, mathematics, AI/ML, databases, cloud, networking, DevOps, general knowledge, and system design. Each row has ground truth for `complexity`, `reasoning`, and `context`.

The split is stored on each row so it does not change between runs:

- 27 calibration rows fit the isotonic models
- 9 validation rows suggest a confidence threshold
- 9 test rows are never used to fit the calibrator

## How calibration is trained and loaded

From the `backend` folder:

```powershell
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.decision.calibration.trainer
```

The trainer calls only the local Ollama model. It writes `calibration/artifacts/raw_predictions.json` after every row, so a stopped run can resume. It fits isotonic regression on the calibration split only and writes `calibration/artifacts/calibrator.json`.

Inference loads that file from disk. Until the file exists, decisions still run, raw and calibrated values match, and `calibration_applied` is `false`.

Raw confidence is the highest raw class probability. Calibrated confidence is the highest probability after isotonic regression and renormalization. Those fields stay separate in every response.

## Confidence threshold

`routing/rules.json` sets `confidence_threshold` to `0.55`. If calibrated complexity confidence or calibrated reasoning confidence is below that value, the route is uncertain and uses `uncertain_fallback` (`cheap` by default).

The evaluation report prints a suggested threshold from the validation split: the lowest candidate at which validation accuracy is at least 0.75. Copy that number into `rules.json` if you want to adopt it. `DECISION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` overrides the file.

## Routing

| Calibrated decision | Model tier |
|---|---|
| simple and low reasoning | `local` |
| medium | `cheap` |
| complex or high reasoning | `strong` |
| calibrated confidence below the threshold | `cheap` fallback |

Change tiers in `routing/rules.json`. The decision model does not contain these rules.

## Evaluation

```powershell
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.decision.evaluation.runner
```

This scores only the test split. It reports accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices, and Brier score for raw and calibrated probabilities, and writes `calibration/artifacts/reliability.svg`. A lower Brier score means the probabilities are closer to the empirical outcome. Calibration is not expected to raise accuracy; it is there so a confidence of 0.80 is closer to an 80% chance of being correct.
